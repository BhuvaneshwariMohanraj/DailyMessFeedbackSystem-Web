- **Trend Detection**: Identify recurring issues
- **Actionable Recommendations**: AI suggests improvements

## üîß API Endpoints (New)

### Admin AI Routes
- `GET /api/admin/insights` - Get AI-powered dashboard insights
- `GET /api/admin/alerts` - Get urgent alerts requiring attention
- `POST /api/admin/test-alerts` - Test the alert system
- `PATCH /api/admin/feedback/:id/status` - Update feedback status
- `POST /api/admin/reanalyze/:id` - Re-analyze feedback with AI

### Feedback Enhancement
- Feedback submission now includes automatic AI analysis
- Real-time alerts triggered for high-priority issues
- Enhanced database schema with AI analysis fields

## üõ† Database Schema Updates

New AI fields added to Feedback table:
```sql
-- AI Analysis Fields
ai_priority_score INT DEFAULT NULL, -- 1-10 priority score
ai_priority_level NVARCHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL, -- LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
ai_sentiment NVARCHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL, -- positive, neutral, negative
ai_category NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL, -- Food Quality, Service, etc.
ai_keywords NVARCHAR(200) DEFAULT NULL, -- JSON array of keywords
ai_summary NVARCHAR(300) DEFAULT NULL, -- AI generated summary
ai_recommended_action NVARCHAR(200) DEFAULT NULL, -- Suggested action
ai_escalation_needed BIT DEFAULT 0, -- Whether escalation is needed
ai_health_safety_concern BIT DEFAULT 0, -- Health/safety flag
ai_analyzed_at DATETIME DEFAULT NULL, -- When AI analysis was done
```

## üß™ Testing the AI System

### 1. Test Feedback Analysis
Submit feedback with different types of comments:

**Health Concern (Should be Priority 10):**
```
"The chicken curry today smelled bad and many students got stomach ache after eating it."
```

**Service Issue (Should be Priority 7-8):**
```
"The food counter was closed during lunch time and staff was very rude to students."
```

**Quality Issue (Should be Priority 4-6):**
```
"The rice was too salty today and the dal was cold."
```

**Positive Feedback (Should be Priority 1-3):**
```
"The food was delicious today, especially the dessert. Great job!"
```

### 2. Test Alert System
1. Submit a high-priority feedback (health concern)
2. Check admin dashboard for real-time alerts
3. Verify email notifications (if configured)
4. Test alert resolution workflow

### 3. Test AI Insights
1. Submit multiple feedback entries
2. Go to AI Insights dashboard
3. Verify sentiment analysis
4. Check category breakdown
5. Review AI-generated insights

## üö® Troubleshooting

### AI Not Working
1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid
2. **Check Quota**: Verify your Gemini API quota isn't exceeded
3. **Check Logs**: Look for AI service errors in backend console
4. **Fallback Analysis**: System uses rule-based analysis if AI fails

### Alerts Not Working
1. **Socket.IO Connection**: Check browser console for connection errors
2. **Email Configuration**: Verify email settings in `.env`
3. **Notification Permissions**: Allow browser notifications

### Performance Issues
1. **API Rate Limits**: Gemini API has rate limits
2. **Database Performance**: AI fields are indexed for better performance
3. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequent queries

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive data
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for AI API calls
4. **Input Validation**: Sanitize user input before AI analysis

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- AI analysis success rate
- Alert response times
- Feedback resolution rates
- Health & safety incident detection
- User satisfaction trends

### Logging
- AI service calls and responses
- Alert triggers and resolutions
- Error rates and failures
- Performance metrics

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Multi-language Support**: Translate feedback before analysis
2. **Image Analysis**: Analyze food photos with AI
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast issues before they occur
4. **Integration**: Connect with mess management systems
5. **Mobile App**: Real-time notifications on mobile devices

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review console logs for errors
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test with simple feedback examples first
